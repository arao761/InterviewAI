      "answer_text": "In our migration to microservices at Tech Corp, we used a strangler fig pattern. \n        We started by identifying bounded contexts and breaking down the monolith gradually. \n        Each service had its own database following the database-per-service pattern. We used \n        Kubernetes for orchestration and implemented API gateway for routing. The key challenges \n        were maintaining data consistency across services - we used event sourcing and CQRS for \n        that. We also implemented circuit breakers and retry logic for resilience. The result \n        was 300% improvement in scalability and much better deployment velocity.",

      "answer_text": "For API optimization, I start with profiling to identify bottlenecks. At StartupXYZ, \n        we had slow database queries. I added proper indexing on frequently queried columns, \n        implemented Redis caching for hot data with a TTL strategy, and used connection pooling. \n        We also implemented pagination for large datasets and added database query optimization \n        like SELECT only needed columns.
